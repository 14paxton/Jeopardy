<p>Ready to play? Well, perhaps you should know the rules first. When this option is selected, you will first be prompted to create teams. All games will allow 2-4 teams; each team will have a default Team Name of "Team #" but here you can change team names to any desired names. Team order is set from top to bottom and cannot be changed. After team names have been chosen, you can either cancel out of the Play Game process, or begin. At any point, the "host" of the game can change the question time limit or each team's score (i.e. a mistake is made and score must be changed to reflect mistake).</p>

<p>Starting from first team, the current team's turn is determined by team's score being highlighted. Selecting any question will reveal question. Answer must be selected or typed (depending on question type) before time limit expires in order for answer to be submitted. When the answer is submitted, the correct answer will be shown. If the submitted answer is correct, the current team's score will increase to the question's associated amount. If the submitted answer is incorrect, the current team's score will decrease. If time limit expires before answer is submitted, it is considered an incorrect answer.</p>

<img src="HelpImgs/DailyDouble.PNG" width="500" height="250">
<p>Within every game, a question is randomly chosen as the game's Daily Double when the game is loaded. When the chosen Daily Double is picked, the current team will be prompted to wager between 100 and 1000 points. Then the question associated will be given. If the submitted answer is correct, the team will earn the amount of points they wagered; if the submitted is incorrect, they will lose the amount of points they wagered.</p>

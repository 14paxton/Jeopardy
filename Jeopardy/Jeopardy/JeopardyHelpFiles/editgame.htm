<h1>Edit Game</h1>

<p>Here you can edit games that have been previously saved or imported. This page is also the page you will be taken to after initial creation of new game.</p>

<h5>Game Information</h5>

<p>You can edit all information set when game was created, including Game Name, Question Time Limit, Number of Categories, and Number of Questions Per Category.  Changing the number of categories or number of questions will automatically change size of Questions board below. Within this section, you will also see the total number of questions in the game, the number of questions that are complete, and the number of questions that are incomplete.</p>

<h5>Categories</h5>

<p>Click on any category to open the Edit Category form for the chosen category. Here you can enter the Category Title and Category Subtitle. You also have the option to import a category from any other game inside the Jeopardy database. If you do so, you will be prompted to another form to choose a game and choose a category from chosen game. You have the choice to import a category's set questions as well. Keep in mind that if you import the category's questions, they will overwrite any questions previously created for the current game's chosen category.</p>

<h5>Questions</h5>

<p>Click on any question button to open the Edit Question form for the chosen question. You start by choosing the question type: Fill in the Blank, Multiple Choice, and True/False. All three options will prompt you to enter the question itself in the Question textbox. If the question is Fill in the Blank, you will enter the exact correct answer in the Answer textbox. If the question is Multiple Choice, you will enter four potential answers for each letter choice (A-D) and you will designate the correct answer by selecting the correct letter's radio button. If the question is True/False, you will select either the true or false option as the correct answer. You can also import questions from any other game in the Jeopardy database. If you do so, you will be prompted to another form to choose a game and choose a category from the chosen game. Then you will choose a specific question from the category, and the question will be imported into the current game's chosen question.</p>

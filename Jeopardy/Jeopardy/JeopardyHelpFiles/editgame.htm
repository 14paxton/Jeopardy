<p>You can edit all information set when game was created, including Game Name, Question Time Limit, Number of Categories, and Number of Questions Per Category.  Changing the number of categories or number of questions will automatically change size of Questions board below. Within this section, you will also see the total number of questions in the game, the number of questions that are complete, and the number of questions that are incomplete.</p>

<h5>Categories</h5>

<p>You also have the option to import a category from any other game inside the Jeopardy database. If you do so, you will be prompted to another form to choose a game and choose a category from chosen game. You have the choice to import a category's set questions as well. Keep in mind that if you import the category's questions, they will overwrite any questions previously created for the current game's chosen category.</p>

<p>If the question is True/False, you will select either the true or false option as the correct answer. You can also import questions from any other game in the Jeopardy database. If you do so, you will be prompted to another form to choose a game and choose a category from the chosen game. Then you will choose a specific question from the category, and the question will be imported into the current game's chosen question.</p>
